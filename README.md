## Project Setup
``` bash
# on root directory
npm install
```

Then create a **.env.local** file in root directory, containing the api key that will be used for fetching weather data. For now you can copy my developer API KEY

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=d1837316bf28a7a921e724a66e7b178d
```

## Running
```bash
npm run dev
```

You can see the output in the following address [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Sometimes Next.js **could not load the proper css styling** that was intended for, in this case you can just reload the page

Have fun!
